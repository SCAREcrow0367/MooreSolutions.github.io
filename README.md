Hello, 

If you are reading this, you have stumbled upon my personal projects and websites that I'm showcasing my ablitiies with. I am doing this for multiple reasons, A. Showcase my talents B. Work on growing my talents C. Become better over time. 

My first project will be my resume/portfolio website. It will be attached my many sources, Linkedin, resume, projects. This will start as a simple page, but who knows, maybe it will grow with time. Instead of being hosted here on github, maybe I finally setup a home server or a serverless situation. So many possibilities, infinite amounts of fun to be had. 

I hope those who find this, find some joy, interesting parts, or maybe some pointers to give me. I am open to all that come to visit with the help that they can provide or just want to connect and grow our networks. 

Thank you for reading, I hope to have many updates as life and career move forward. 

Warmest Regards,
 
Crow
